# Stradivarius website recreation
Recreation of the Stradivarius website, with some changes.

## Libraries used
- GlideJS for carousels 

## Purpose of the website
This website was created for a challenge at my study. I kept the navigation on the Stradivarius homepage the same, as well as the first slideshow. However, I changed the rest of the homepage with more slideshows with products. The fonts and images that are used are the same as on the Stradivarius page. 

## Who created what?
Me, Iris created the navigation bar and the homepage, and Sem worked on the footer of the webpage and made a productpage. The productpage is not included in this repo.
